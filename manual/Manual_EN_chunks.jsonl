Consult an authorized HYUNDAI dealer for additional information. WARNING • Do not \"top off\" after the nozzle automatically shuts off when refueling. • Always check that the fuel cap is installed securely to prevent fuel spillage in the event of an accident. Gasoline containing alcohol or methanol Gasohol, a mixture of gasoline and ethanol (also known as grain alcohol) are being marketed along with or instead of leaded or unleaded gasoline. For example, \"E15\" is a gasohol comprised of 15 % ethanol and 85 % gasoline. Do not use gasohol containing more than 15 % ethanol, and do not use gasoline or gasohol containing any methanol. Either of these fuels may cause drivability problems and damage to the fuel system, engine control system and emission control system. Discontinue using gasohol of any kind if drivability problems occur. \"E85\" fuel is an alternative fuel comprised of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline, and is manufactured exclusively for use in Flexible Fuel Vehicles. \"E85\" is not compatible with your vehicle. Use of \"E85\" may result in poor engine performance and damage to your vehicle's engine and fuel system. Do not use fuel with an ethanol content exceeding 15 percent. NOTICE To prevent damage to your vehicle's engine and fuel system: • Never use gasohol which contains methanol. • Never use gasohol containing more than 15 % ethanol. • Never use leaded fuel or leaded gasohol. • Never use \"E85\" fuel.

The main purpose of an EDR is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an airbag deployment or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's systems performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is designed to record such data as: • How various systems in your vehicle were operating; • Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened; • How far (if at all) the driver was depressing the accelerator and/or brake pedal; and, • How fast the vehicle was traveling. These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving conditions and no personal data (for example, name, gender, age, and crash location) are recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash investigation. To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed. In addition to the vehicle manufacturer, other parties that have the special equipment, such as law enforcement, can read the information if they have access to the vehicle or the EDR. 1-12", "page": 18, "font_size": 14.0, "column": null}

This is especially important in dusty or sandy areas and when the vehicle is used on unpaved roads. Cleaning the plug and dipstick areas will prevent dirt and grit from entering the engine and other mechanisms that could be damaged. • Never add any additives to the engine oil. Engine oil additives can change the properties of engine oil and may cause serious engine failure. Engine oil viscosity (thickness) has an effect on fuel economy and cold weather operating (engine start and engine oil flow ability). Typically, lower viscosity engine oils can provide better fuel economy and cold weather performance, however, higher viscosity engine oils are required for satisfactory lubrication in hot weather. Using oils of any viscosity other than those recommended could result in engine damage. When choosing an oil, consider the range of temperature your vehicle will be operated in before the next oil change. Proceed to select the recommended oil viscosity from the chart.

During a moderate to severe frontal collision, sensors detect the vehicle's rapid deceleration. If the rate of deceleration is high enough, the SRSCM inflates the front airbags with the force needed. The front airbags help protect the driver and front passenger by responding to frontal impacts in which seat belts alone cannot provide adequate restraint. When needed, the side airbags help provide protection in the event of a side impact or rollover by supporting the side upper body area. • Airbags are activated (able to inflate if necessary) only when the Engine Start/Stop button is in the ON or START position, and it may be activated within 3 minutes after the engine is turned off. • Airbags inflate in the event of certain frontal or side collisions to help protect the occupants from serious physical injury. • There is no single speed at which the airbags will inflate. Generally, airbags are designed to inflate based upon the severity of a collision and its direction. Airbag deployment also depends on a number of other factors including vehicle speed, angles of impact and the density and stiffness of the vehicles or objects which your vehicle impacts during a collision.

It gives the driving feel of a manual transmission, yet provides the ease of a fully automatic transmission. • When D (Drive) is selected, the transmission automatically shifts through the gears similar to a conventional automatic transmission. Unlike a traditional automatic transmission, the gear shifting can sometimes be felt and heard as the actuators engage the clutches and the gears are selected. • The dual clutch transmission incorporates a wet-type dual clutch mechanism, which allows for better acceleration performance and increased fuel efficiency while driving. But it differs from a conventional automatic transmission because it does not incorporate a torque converter. Instead, the transition from one gear to the next is managed by clutch slip, especially at lower speeds. As a result, shifts are sometimes more noticeable, and a light vibration can be felt as the transmission shaft speed is matched with the engine shaft speed. This is a normal condition of the dual clutch transmission. • The wet-type clutch transfers torque more directly and provides a direct drive feeling which may feel different from a conventional automatic transmission.

The ORVR system is designed to allow the vapors from the fuel tank to be loaded into a canister while refueling at the gas station, preventing the escape of fuel vapors into the atmosphere. Canister Fuel vapors generated inside the fuel tank are absorbed and stored in the onboard canister. When the engine is running, the fuel vapors absorbed in the canister are drawn into the surge tank through the purge control solenoid valve. Purge Control Solenoid Valve (PCSV) The purge control solenoid valve is controlled by the Engine Control Module (ECM); when the engine coolant temperature is low during idling, the PCSV closes so that evaporated fuel is not taken into the engine.
