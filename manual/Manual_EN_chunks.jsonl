The SRSCM (Supplemental Restraint System Control Module) continually monitors all SRS components while the Engine Start/Stop button is ON to determine if a crash impact is severe enough to require airbag deployment or pretensioner seat belt deployment. During a moderate to severe frontal collision, sensors detect the vehicle's rapid deceleration. If the rate of deceleration is high enough, the SRSCM inflates the front airbags with the force needed. The front airbags help protect the driver and front passenger by responding to frontal impacts in which seat belts alone cannot provide adequate restraint. When needed, the side airbags help provide protection in the event of a side impact or rollover by supporting the side upper body area. • Airbags are activated (able to inflate if necessary) only when the Engine Start/Stop button is in the ON or START position, and it may be activated within 3 minutes after the engine is turned off. • Airbags inflate in the event of certain frontal or side collisions to help protect the occupants from serious physical injury. • There is no single speed at which the airbags will inflate. Generally, airbags are designed to inflate based upon the severity of a collision and its direction. Airbag deployment also depends on a number of other factors including vehicle speed, angles of impact and the density and stiffness of the vehicles or objects which your vehicle impacts during a collision. The determining factors are not limited to those mentioned above. • The front airbags completely inflate and deflate in an instant.

To prevent transmission wear, wait until the wheels stop spinning before shifting gears. Release the accelerator pedal while shifting, and press lightly on the accelerator pedal while the transmission is in gear. Slowly spinning the wheels in forward and reverse directions causes a rocking motion that may free the vehicle. WARNING Always turn off the ESC system before rocking the vehicle. If the vehicle is stuck and excessive wheel spin occurs, the temperature in the tires may increase very quickly. If the tires become damaged, a tire blow out or tire explosion may occur - you and others may be injured. Do not attempt this procedure if people or objects are near the vehicle. If you attempt to free the vehicle, the vehicle may overheat quickly, possibly causing an engine compartment fire or other damage. Try to avoid spinning the wheels as much as possible to prevent overheating of the tires or the engine. DO NOT allow the vehicle to spin the wheels above 35 mph (56 km/h). If you are still stuck after rocking the vehicle a few times, have your vehicle pulled out by a tow vehicle to avoid engine overheating, possible damage to the transmission, and tire damage.

If your tires do not have enough tread, making a quick stop on wet pavement may cause a skid and possibly lead to a collision. Refer to the \"Tires And Wheels\" section in Chapter • Turn on your headlights to make it easier for others to see you. Using your headlights when using your windshield wipers is required in some jurisdictions. • Driving too fast through large puddles may affect your brakes. If you must go through puddles, try to drive through them slowly. • If you believe your brakes are wet, apply them several times while the vehicle is moving slowly. Hydroplaning If the road is wet enough and you are driving fast enough, your vehicle may have little or no contact with the road surface and actually ride on the water.

{"id": 273, "title": "Refueling Vapor Recovery (ORVR)", "content": "(ORVR) The Evaporative Emission Control System is designed to prevent fuel vapors from escaping into the atmosphere. The ORVR system is designed to allow the vapors from the fuel tank to be loaded into a canister while refueling at the gas station, preventing the escape of fuel vapors into the atmosphere. Canister Fuel vapors generated inside the fuel tank are absorbed and stored in the onboard canister. When the engine is running, the fuel vapors absorbed in the canister are drawn into the surge tank through the purge control solenoid valve. Purge Control Solenoid Valve (PCSV) The purge control solenoid valve is controlled by the Engine Control Module (ECM); when the engine coolant temperature is low during idling, the PCSV closes so that evaporated fuel is not taken into the engine. After the engine warms-up during ordinary driving, the PCSV opens to introduce evaporated fuel to the engine.", "page": 486, "font_size": 12.0, "column": "right"}
