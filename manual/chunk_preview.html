Vehicle Data Collection And Event Data Recorders

This vehicle is equipped with an event data recorder (EDR). The main purpose of an EDR 
is to record, in certain crash or near crash-like situations, such as an airbag deployment 
or hitting a road obstacle, data that will assist in understanding how a vehicle's systems 
performed. The EDR is designed to record data related to vehicle dynamics and safety 
systems for a short period of time, typically 30 seconds or less. The EDR in this vehicle is 
designed to record such data as:
• How various systems in your vehicle were operating;
• Whether or not the driver and passenger safety belts were buckled/fastened;
• How far (if at all)</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 32</h2><pre>[Summary]:  EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a non-trivial crash occurs .

• How fast the vehicle was traveling. These data can help provide a better understanding of the circumstances in which 
crashes and injuries occur. NOTE: EDR data are recorded by your vehicle only if a 
non-trivial crash situation occurs; no data are recorded by the EDR under normal driving 
conditions and no personal data (for example, name, gender, age, and crash location) are 
recorded. However, other parties, such as law enforcement, could combine the EDR data 
with the type of personally identifying data routinely acquired during a crash 
investigation.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 33</h2><pre>[Summary]:  To read data recorded by an EDR, special equipment is required, and access to the vehicle or the EDR is needed . Other parties that have the special equipment, such as law enforcement, can read the information .

Important Safety 
Precautions
You will find many safety precautions and 
recommendations throughout this 
section, and throughout this manual. The 
safety precautions in this section are 
among the most important. Always wear your seat belt
A seat belt is your best protection in all 
types of accidents. Airbags are designed 
to supplement seat belts, not to replace 
them. So even though your vehicle is 
equipped with airbags, always make sure 
you and your passengers wear your seat 
belts, and wear them properly.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 64</h2><pre>[Summary]:  Infants and small children should be restrained in an appropriate Child Restraint System . Larger children should use a booster seat until they can use the lap/shoulder belt .
[Content]: Restrain all children
All children under age 13 should ride in 
your vehicle properly restrained in a rear 
seat, not the front seat. Infants and small 
children should be restrained in an 
appropriate Child Restraint System. Larger children should use a booster seat 
with the lap/shoulder belt until they can 
use the seat belt properly without a 
booster seat. Airbag hazards
While airbags can save lives, they can also 
cause serious or fatal injuries to 
occupants who sit too close to them, or 
who are not properly restrained. Infants, 
young children, and short adults are at the 
greatest risk of being injured by an 
inflating airbag.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 65</h2><pre>[Summary]:  Driver distraction presents a serious and potentially deadly danger, especially for experienced drivers .

[Content]: Follow all instructions 
and warnings in this manual. Driver distraction
Driver distraction presents a serious and 
potentially deadly danger, especially for 
inexperienced drivers. Safety should be 
the primary concern when behind the 
wheel and drivers need to be aware of the 
wide array of potential distractions, such 
as drowsiness, reaching for objects, 
eating, personal grooming, other 
passengers, and using mobile phones. Drivers can become distracted when they 
take their eyes and attention off the road 
or their hands off the wheel to focus on 
activities other than driving. To reduce 
your risk of distraction and an accident:
• Set up your mobile devices (for 
example, MP3 players, phones, 
navigation units, etc.)</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 66</h2><pre>[Summary]:  Only use your mobile device when allowed by laws and conditions permit safe use . NEVER text or email while driving . Only when your  vehicle is parked or safely stopped .

and drive. Control your speed
Excessive speed is a major factor in crash

[Content]: The SRSCM (Supplemental Restraint 
System Control Module) continually 
monitors all SRS components while the 
Engine Start/Stop button is ON to 
determine if a crash impact is severe 
enough to require airbag deployment or 
pretensioner seat belt deployment. During a moderate to severe frontal 
collision, sensors detect the vehicle's 
rapid deceleration. If the rate of 
deceleration is high enough, the SRSCM 
inflates the front airbags with the force 
needed. The front airbags help protect the driver 
and front passenger by responding to 
frontal impacts in which seat belts alone 
cannot provide adequate restraint. When 
needed, the side airbags help provide 
protection in the event of a side impact or 
rollover by supporting the side upper 
body area.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 207</h2><pre>[Summary]:  There is no single speed at which airbags will inflate . Airbags are activated (able to inflate if necessary) only when the Engine                 Start/Stop button is in the ON or START position .
[Content]: • Airbags are activated (able to inflate if 
necessary) only when the Engine 
Start/Stop button is in the ON or START 
position, and it may be activated within 
3 minutes after the engine is turned off. • Airbags inflate in the event of certain 
frontal or side collisions to help protect 
the occupants from serious physical 
injury. • There is no single speed at which the 
airbags will inflate. Generally, airbags 
are designed to inflate based upon the 
severity of a collision and its direction. Airbag deployment also depends on a 
number of other factors including 
vehicle speed, angles of impact and the 
density and stiffness of the vehicles or 
objects which your vehicle impacts 
during a collision.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 208</h2><pre>[Summary]:  The determining factors are not limited to those mentioned above . Front airbags completely inflate and deflate in an instant . It is virtually impossible for you to see the airbags inflate during an accident .

of serious or life-threatening injuries 
and is thus a necessary part of airbag 
design. However, the rapid airbag inflation may 
also cause injuries that include facial 
abrasions, bruises, and broken bones 
because the inflation speed also causes 
the airbags to expand with great force. • There are even circumstances under 
which contact with the airbag may 
cause fatal injuries, especially when the

transmission, the gear shifting can 
sometimes be felt and heard as the

Control (ESC) system. It helps the vehicle 
stay stable when accelerating or braking 
suddenly on wet, slippery and rough 
roads where traction over the four tires 
can suddenly become uneven. WARNING
 
VSM is not a substitute for safe driving 
practices. To prevent serious injury or 
death:
• Always monitor the speed and the 
distance to the vehicle ahead of you. • Never drive too fast for the road 
conditions.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 852</h2><pre>[Summary]:  When you apply your brakes under conditions that can activate ESC, you may hear sounds from the brakes, or feel a corresponding sensation in the brake pedal .

in order to maintain a safe distance. WARNING
 
In the following situations, Smart Cruise 
Control may not warn the driver of a 
collision. • The distance from the front vehicle is 
near, or the vehicle speed of the front 
vehicle is faster or similar with your 
vehicle
• The speed of the front vehicle is very 
slow or is at a standstill

 WARNING Take the following precautions when 
using Smart Cruise Control:
• Smart Cruise Control does not 
substitute for proper and safe driving. It 
is the responsibility of the driver to 
always check the speed and distance to 
the vehicle ahead. • Smart Cruise Control may not 
recognize unexpected and sudden 
situations or complex driving 
situations, so always pay attention to 
driving conditions and control your 
vehicle speed. • Keep Smart Cruise Control off when the 
function is not in use to avoid 
inadvertently setting a speed.
• Do not open the door or leave the 
vehicle when Smart Cruise Control is 
operating, even if the vehicle is 
stopped.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 1136</h2><pre>[Summary]:  Smart Cruise Control may suddenly accelerate to the set speed . Keep a safe distance according to road conditions and vehicle speed . If the front vehicle agicallydisappears, Smart Cruise control may accelerate .

Radial-Ply Tires
Radial-ply tires provide improved 
tread life, road hazard resistance and 
smoother high speed ride. The 
radial-ply tires used on this vehicle 
are of belted construction, and are 
selected to complement the ride and 
handling characteristics of your 
vehicle. Radial-ply tires have the 
same load carrying capacity, as 
bias-ply or bias belted tires of the 
same size, and use the same 
recommended inflation pressure. Mixing of radial-ply tires with bias-ply 
or bias belted tires is not 
recommended. Any combinations of 
radial-ply and bias-ply or bias belted 
tires when used on the same vehicle 
will seriously deteriorate vehicle 
handling.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 1519</h2><pre>[Summary]:  Radial-ply tires are repairable only in the tread area, because of sidewall flexing . Longer wearing tires can be more susceptible to irregular tread wear .
[Content]: The best rule to follow is: 
Identical pairs of radial-ply tires 
should always be used as a set for the 
front tires and a set for the rear tires. Longer wearing tires can be more 
susceptible to irregular tread wear. It 
is very important to follow the tire 
rotation interval in this chapter to 
achieve the tread life potential of 
these tires. Cuts and punctures in 
radial-ply tires are repairable only in 
the tread area, because of sidewall 
flexing. Consult your tire dealer for 
radial-ply tire repairs.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 1520</h2><pre>[Summary]:  WARNING: Do not mix bias ply and radial ply tires under any circumstances . Low aspect ratio tires are optimized for handling and braking . They are wider and have a greater contact with the road surface .
[Content]: WARNING
 
Do not mix bias ply and radial ply tires 
under any circumstances. This may 
cause unusual handling 
characteristics that may cause loss of 
vehicle control resulting in an 
accident. Low aspect ratio tires
The aspect ratio is lower than 50 on 
low aspect ratio tires. Because low aspect ratio tires are 
optimized for handling and braking, 
their sidewall is a little stiffer than a 
standard tire. Also low aspect ratio 
tires tend to be wider and 
consequently have a greater contact 
patch with the road surface.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 1521</h2><pre>[Summary]:  Low aspect wheels and tires may generate more noise compared with standard tires . Inspect the tire condition and tire pressure every 1,800 mi. (3,000 km)
[Content]: In some 
instances they may generate more 
road noise compared with standard 
tires. CAUTION
 
Low aspect wheels and tires are 
easily damaged. To reduce the risk of 
damage:
• When driving on rough roads, 
passing over a pothole, speed 
bump, manhole, or curb stone, 
drive the vehicle slowly not to 
damage the tires and wheels. Damage is not covered by your 
vehicle warranty. • Inspect the tire condition and

Corrosion protection
Protecting your vehicle from corrosion
By using the most advanced design and 
construction practices to combat 
corrosion, HYUNDAI produces vehicles of 
the highest quality. However, this is only 
part of the job. To achieve the longterm 
corrosion resistance your vehicle can 
deliver, the owner's cooperation and 
assistance are also required. Common causes of corrosion
The most common causes of corrosion on 
your vehicle are:
• Road salt, dirt and moisture that is 
allowed to accumulate underneath the 
vehicle. • Removal of paint or protective coatings 
by stones, gravel, abrasion or minor 
scrapes and dents which leave 
unprotected metal exposed to 
corrosion.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 1565</h2><pre>[Summary]:  Moisture creates the conditions in which corrosion is most likely to occur . Road salts, ocean air and industrial pollution are common causes of accelerated corrosion .
[Content]: High-corrosion areas
If you live in an area where your vehicle is 
regularly exposed to corrosive materials, 
corrosion protection is particularly 
important. Some of the common causes 
of accelerated corrosion are road salts, 
dust control chemicals, ocean air and 
industrial pollution. Moisture breeds corrosion
Moisture creates the conditions in which 
corrosion is most likely to occur. For 
example, corrosion is accelerated by high 
humidity, particularly when temperatures 
are just above freezing. In such 
conditions, the corrosive material is kept 
in contact with the vehicle surfaces by 
moisture that is slow to evaporate.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 1566</h2><pre>[Summary]:  Mud is particularly corrosive because it is slow to dry and holds moisture in contact with the vehicle . High temperatures can also accelerate corrosion of parts that are not properly ventilated so the moisture can be dispersed .
[Content]: Mud is particularly corrosive because it is 
slow to dry and holds moisture in contact 
with the vehicle. Although the mud 
appears to be dry, it can still retain 
moisture and promote corrosion. High temperatures can also accelerate 
corrosion of parts that are not properly 
ventilated so the moisture can be 
dispersed. For all these reasons, it is 
particularly important to keep your 
vehicle clean and free of mud or 
accumulations of other materials. This 
applies not only to the visible surfaces but 
particularly to the underside of the 
vehicle.</pre></div><div class="chunk"><h2>Chunk 1567</h2><pre>[Summary]:  The best way to prevent corrosion is to keep your vehicle clean and free of corrosive materials .

Keep your vehicle clean
The best way to prevent corrosion is to 
keep your vehicle clean and free of 
corrosive materials. Attention to the 
underside of the vehicle is particularly 
important. • If you live in a high-corrosion area - 
where road salts are used, near the 
ocean, areas with industrial pollution, 
acid rain, etc.-, you should take extra 
care to prevent corrosion. In winter, 
hose off the underside of your vehicle 
at least once a month and be sure to
